#  Classification of satellite multispectral imagery with Machine Learning algorithms

The project involves applying Machine Learning techniques (SVM, Random Forest, and K-means) to remote sensing.

For the SVM task, the region of interest (ROI) includes San Francisco, San Jose, and Sacramento, three major cities in the state of California (USA), with a particular focus on the San Francisco Bay area. For the K-means and Random Forest tasks, I selected a different region of interest (ROI2), i.e. Cairns, a city located in the tropical north of Queensland, Australia, which is known as the gateway to the Great Barrier Reef

The goal is to identify and quantify various types of land cover. For example, it is possible to measure the area of a lake in $m^2$ and observe how it changes over the years due to phenomena such as drought.
